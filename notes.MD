### 22. Number Manipulation and F Strings

##### Float division

Use 2 slashes to do **float division**. In a float division the result will be converted to ***int*** instead of output a float number..

```python
print(8 // 3)
console output: 2
```

##### F-string

Put an **f** before the quoted string and use curly braces to include the variables outside the string to be used as strings in the f-string.

```python
weight = 1.75
score = 0
winning = True
print(f"Your weight is {1.75}m, your score is {score} and you are winning is {winning}")
```
